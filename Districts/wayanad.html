      </h2>
      <p class="lead text-white">Edakkal Caves also Edakal, are two natural caves at Edakkal, in Wayanad district of Kerala. The caves are situated 1,200 m above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, on the Mysore Plateau, in the Western Ghats. The Edakkal caves are believed to be camping shelters of the Neolithic community. The cave walls contain a collection of Neolithic rock engravings and images. The major part of images on the cave walls may belong to late Neolithic period. With the exception of Edakkal, no concrete evidence for the existence of a true Neolithic culture in Kerala has so far been discovered. The caves were discovered by Fred Fawcett, Superintendent of Police, Malabar District in 1896 who immediately recognised their anthropological and historical importance.</p>
